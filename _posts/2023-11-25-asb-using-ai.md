It has been a while since I've worked on the [AutoSortBookmarks (ASB) add-on For Firefox](https://github.com/eric-bixby/auto-sort-bookmarks-webext).
I haven't forgotten about it, I've just been busy, lazy, or sick.

With all the buzz about chatGPT, I've decided to use chatGPT to generate all the code for ASB from the ground up.
So far, I've done an essential alphabetical sort with no user options.  The code looked good to me.
Next, I will add more features until it matches what I have now.

My work does not allow the use of AI technology, so I'm practicing AI coding with this project in anticipation of
the day when AI is allowed.
