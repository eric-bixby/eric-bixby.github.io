My name is Eric Bixby. I have the following qualities:

- I love coffee but don't consider myself a snob
- I'm extremely loyal to my family and friends
- I would be writting software even if it wasn't my job

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)) and it will answer **all** your questions.  Just kidding.  I'm not a hacker as protrayed in the [Hackers movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)).  Although, I do enjoy that genre of movie.  I consider myself a [hacker in the original meaning of the word](https://slate.com/technology/2015/01/modern-technology-and-the-history-of-the-word-hack.html).
